<br>By, by, lully, lullay.
<br>Lullay, Thou little tiny Child.
<br>By, by, lully, lullay.
<br>
</p><p>O sisters, too, how may we do,
<br>For to preserve this day;
<br>This poor Youngling for whom we sing,
<br>By, by, lully, lullay.
<br>
</p><p>Herod the King, in his raging,
<br>Charged he hath this day;
<br>His men of might, in his own sight,
<br>All children young, to slay.
<br>
</p><p>Then woe is me, poor Child, for Thee,
<br>And ever mourn and say;
<br>For Thy parting, nor say nor sing,
<br>By, by, lully, lullay.
