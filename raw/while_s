While shepherds watched

#Nahum Tate, often to the tune 'Cranbrook'

While shepherds watched
Their flocks by night
All seated on the ground
The angel of the Lord came down
#And glory shone around
#And glory shone around

"Fear not," he said,
For mighty dread
Had seized their troubled minds
"Glad tidings of great joy I bring
#To you and all mankind,
#To you and all mankind."

"To you in David's
Town this day
Is born of David's line
The Savior who is Christ the Lord
#And this shall be the sign
#And this shall be the sign."

"The heavenly Babe
You there shall find
To human view displayed
And meanly wrapped
In swathing bands
#And in a manger laid
#And in a manger laid."

Thus spake the seraph,
And forthwith
Appeared a shining throng
Of angels praising God, who thus
#Addressed their joyful song
#Addressed their joyful song

"All glory be to
God on high
And to the earth be peace;
Goodwill henceforth
From heaven to men
#Begin and never cease
#Begin and never cease!"
