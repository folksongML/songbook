<h2 id=>O come, O come, Emmanuel
</h2>
</p><p><i>Translated from a 12th C latin hymn
</i><br>
</p><p><h2 id=>O come, O come, Emmanuel
</h2>And ransom captive Israel
<br>That mourns in lonely exile here
<br>Until the Son of God appear
<br><i>Rejoice! Rejoice! Emmanuel
</i><br><i>Shall come to thee, O Israel.
</i><br>
</p><p>O come, Thou Rod of Jesse, free
<br>Thine own from Satan's tyranny
<br>From depths of Hell Thy people save
<br>And give them victory o'er the grave
<br><i>Rejoice! Rejoice! Emmanuel
</i><br><i>Shall come to thee, O Israel.
</i><br>
</p><p>O come, Thou Day-Spring, come and cheer
<br>Our spirits by Thine advent here
<br>Disperse the gloomy clouds of night
<br>And death's dark shadows put to flight.
<br><i>Rejoice! Rejoice! Emmanuel
</i><br><i>Shall come to thee, O Israel.
</i><br>
</p><p>O come, Thou Key of David, come,
<br>And open wide our heavenly home;
<br>Make safe the way that leads on high,
<br>And close the path to misery.
<br><i>Rejoice! Rejoice! Emmanuel
</i><br><i>Shall come to thee, O Israel.
</i><br>
</p><p>O come, O come, Thou Lord of might,
<br>Who to Thy tribes, on Sinai's height,
<br>In ancient times did'st give the Law,
<br>In cloud, and majesty and awe.
<br><i>Rejoice! Rejoice! Emmanuel
</i><br><i>Shall come to thee, O Israel.
