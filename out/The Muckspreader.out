<h2 id=''>The Muckspreader
</h2><i>The Yetties
</i><br>
</p><p>Now down on our farm we are right up to date,
<br>And mechanisation's the byword of late.
<br>For every task we've a gadget to match,
<br>But our new muckspreader's the best of the batch.
<br>
</p><p><i>Fling it here, fling it there.
</i><br><i>If you're standing by then you'll all get your share.
</i><br>
</p><p>Now young Walter Hodgekins he brought back a load
<br>Of liquid manure from the farm down the road
<br>And he hummed to himself as he drove down the street -
<br>And his load it went hummmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm in the afternoon heat.
<br>
</p><p><i>Fling it here, fling it there.
</i><br><i>If you're standing by then you'll all get your share.
</i><br>
</p><p>Now his muckspreader had a mechanical fault
<br>And a bump in the road set it off with a jolt.
<br>An odourous spray of manure it let fly
<br>Without fear or favour on all it passed by.
<br>
</p><p><i>Fling it here, fling it there.
</i><br><i>If you're standing by then you'll all get your share.
</i><br>
</p><p>The cats and the dogs stank to high kingdom come;
<br>The kiddies, browned off, ran home screaming to Mum.
<br>The trail of sheer havoc were terrible grim -
<br>One open car were filled up to the brim.
<br>
</p><p><i>Fling it here, fling it there.
</i><br><i>If you're standing by then you'll all get your share.
</i><br>
</p><p>The spinster, Miss Pringle, was quite scandalised.
<br>"Good Gracious", she cried, "I've been fertilised".
<br>And the Methodist minister's tee-total wife
<br>Was plastered for the very first time in her life.
<br>
</p><p><i>Fling it here, fling it there.
</i><br><i>If you're standing by then you'll all get your share.
</i><br>
</p><p>The vicarage windows were all open wide
<br>When a generous helping descended inside.
<br>The vicar at table intoned "let us pray".
<br>When this manure from heaven came flying his way.
<br>
</p><p><i>Fling it here, fling it there.
</i><br><i>If you're standing by then you'll all get your share.
</i><br>
</p><p>Now all of this time as he'd trundled along
<br>He was quite unaware there was anything wrong
<br>'Till a vision of woe flagged him down, what a sight,
<br>A policeman all covered in ... you've got it right.
<br>
</p><p><i>Fling it here, fling it there.
</i><br><i>If you're standing by then you'll all get your share.
</i><br>
</p><p><i>Fling it here, fling it there.
</i><br><i>If you're standing by then you'll all get your share.
