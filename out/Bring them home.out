<h2 id=''>Bring them home
</h2>
</p><p>From a distant town 
<br>I can hear an anvil ring
<br>Round a blazing fire
<br>a thousand voices ring
<br>of a time coming soon
<br>when the order will reverse
<br>when the first shall be last
<br>and the last shall be first
<br>
</p><p><i>We will bring them home
</i><br><i>We will bring them home
</i><br><i>from the courts of the mighty 
</i><br><i>with their hearts of stone
</i><br><i>We will bring them home
</i><br><i>We will bring them home
</i><br><i>We'll reach out across the ocean
</i><br><i>and we'll bring them home
</i><br>
</p><p>In the deepest mine
<br>and the dark satanic mills
<br>at the cutting of a seam
<br>and the spinning of the wheels
<br>on the raging deep
<br>and the ploughing of the land
<br>many tounges will sing
<br>of the rights of man
<br>
</p><p><i>We will bring them home
</i><br><i>We will bring them home
</i><br><i>from the courts of the mighty 
</i><br><i>with their hearts of stone
</i><br><i>We will bring them home
</i><br><i>We will bring them home
</i><br><i>We'll reach out across the ocean
</i><br><i>and we'll bring them home
</i><br>
</p><p>From an acron small 
<br>a mighty oak will rise
<br>if speak as one
<br>we'll together win the price
<br>raise your voices hight
<br>let them ring througout the land
<br>and for justice now
<br>we'll together make a stand
<br>
