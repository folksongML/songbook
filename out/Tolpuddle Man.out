<h2 id=''>Tolpuddle Man
</h2>
</p><p>Farewell to my family
<br>it's now I must leave you
<br>that far fateful shore
<br>in chains we shall see
<br>although we are taken
<br>do not be mistaken
<br>as brothers in union
<br>we shall be free
<br>
</p><p><i>They can bring down our wages
</i><br><i>starve all our children
</i><br><i>in chains they can bind us
</i><br><i>steal all our land
</i><br><i>They can mock our religion
</i><br><i>from our family divide us
</i><br><i>but they can't break the oath
</i><br><i>of a Tolpuddle man
</i><br>
</p><p>To those who rule us
<br>we are the dissenters
<br>do your duty, be thankful
<br>don't complain, we are told
<br>for God in his wisdom
<br>divided his kingdom
<br>for few to have much
<br>while so many have nought
<br>
</p><p><i>They can bring down our wages
</i><br><i>starve all our children
</i><br><i>in chains they can bind us
</i><br><i>steal all our land
</i><br><i>They can mock our religion
</i><br><i>from our family divide us
</i><br><i>but they can't break the oath
</i><br><i>of a Tolpuddle man
</i><br>
</p><p>As brothers together
<br>with an oath we will bind us
<br>the labouring man 
<br>in all England shall rise
<br>though Fampton has framed us
<br>they never will tame us
<br>arise men of Britian
<br>We'll yet win the prize
<br>
