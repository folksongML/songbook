</h2><i>Great Big Sea

</p><p><i>And its go boys go
</i><br><i>They'll time your every breath
</i><br><i>And every day in this place 
</i><br><i>you're two days near to death
</i><br><i>But you go
</i><br>
</p><p>Well a process man am I 
<br>and I'm tellin' you no lie
<br>I work and breathe among the fumes 
<br>that trail across the sky
<br>There's thunder all around me 
<br>and there's poison in the air
<br>There's a lousy smell that smacks of hell 
<br>and dust all in me hair
<br>
</p><p><i>And its go boys go
</i><br><i>They'll time your every breath
</i><br><i>And every day in this place 
</i><br><i>you're two days near to death
</i><br><i>But you go
</i><br>
</p><p>Well I've worked among the spitters 
<br>and I breathe the oily smoke
<br>I've shovelled up the gypsum 
<br>and it neigh 'on makes you choke
<br>I've stood knee deep cyanide, 
<br>got sick with a caustic burn
<br>Been working rough, I've seen enough, 
<br>to make your stomach turn
<br>
</p><p><i>And its go boys go
</i><br><i>They'll time your every breath
</i><br><i>And every day in this place 
</i><br><i>you're two days near to death
</i><br><i>But you go
</i><br>
</p><p>There's overtime and bonuses 
<br>opportunities galore
<br>The young men like their money 
<br>and they all come back for more
<br>But soon your knocking on 
<br>looking older than you should
<br>For every bob made on the job, 
<br>you pay with flesh and blood
<br>
</p><p><i>And its go boys go
</i><br><i>They'll time your every breath
</i><br><i>And every day in this place 
</i><br><i>you're two days near to death
</i><br><i>But you go
</i><br>
