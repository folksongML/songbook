</p><p><h2 id=>While shepherds watched
</h2>Their flocks by night
<br>All seated on the ground
<br>The angel of the Lord came down
<br><i>And glory shone around
</i><br><i>And glory shone around
</i><br>
</p><p>"Fear not," he said,
<br>For mighty dread
<br>Had seized their troubled minds
<br>"Glad tidings of great joy I bring
<br><i>To you and all mankind,
</i><br><i>To you and all mankind."
</i><br>
</p><p>"To you in David's
<br>Town this day
<br>Is born of David's line
<br>The Savior who is Christ the Lord
<br><i>And this shall be the sign
</i><br><i>And this shall be the sign."
</i><br>
</p><p>"The heavenly Babe
<br>You there shall find
<br>To human view displayed
<br>And meanly wrapped
<br>In swathing bands
<br><i>And in a manger laid
</i><br><i>And in a manger laid."
</i><br>
</p><p>Thus spake the seraph,
<br>And forthwith
<br>Appeared a shining throng
<br>Of angels praising God, who thus
<br><i>Addressed their joyful song
</i><br><i>Addressed their joyful song
</i><br>
</p><p>"All glory be to
<br>God on high
<br>And to the earth be peace;
<br>Goodwill henceforth
<br>From heaven to men
<br><i>Begin and never cease
</i><br><i>Begin and never cease!"
