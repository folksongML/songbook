<h2 id=>The First Noel
</h2>
</p><p>The First Noel, the Angels did say
<br>Was to certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay
<br>In fields where they lay keeping their sheep
<br>On a cold winter's night that was so deep.
<br>Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel
<br>Born is the King of Israel!
<br>
</p><p>They looked up and saw a star
<br>Shining in the East beyond them far
<br>And to the earth it gave great light
<br>And so it continued both day and night.
<br>Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel
<br>Born is the King of Israel!
<br>
</p><p>And by the light of that same star
<br>Three Wise men came from country far
<br>To seek for a King was their intent
<br>And to follow the star wherever it went.
<br>Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel
<br>Born is the King of Israel!
<br>
</p><p>This star drew nigh to the northwest
<br>O'er Bethlehem it took its rest
<br>And there it did both Pause and stay
<br>Right o'er the place where Jesus lay.
<br>Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel
<br>Born is the King of Israel!
<br>
</p><p>Then entered in those Wise men three
<br>Full reverently upon their knee
<br>And offered there in His presence
<br>Their gold and myrrh and frankincense.
<br>Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel
<br>Born is the King of Israel! 
<br>
</p><p>Then let us all with one accord
<br>Sing praises to our heavenly Lord
<br>That hath made Heaven and earth of nought
<br>And with his blood mankind has bought.
<br>Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel
<br>Born is the King of Israel!
