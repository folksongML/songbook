<h2 id=''>Captain Wedderburn's Courtship
</h2>
</p><p>The Earl of Rosslyn's daughter 
<br>walked through the woods alone
<br>When by came Captain Wedderburn, 
<br>a servant of the King.
<br>He said unto his servant man, 
<br>“Were it not against the law
<br>I'd take her into my own bed 
<br>and lie her next to the wall.”
<br>
</p><p>So he jumped off his milk-white steed 
<br>and he set the lady on,
<br>And all the way he walked on foot 
<br>and he held her by the hand.
<br>He held her by the middle of the waist 
<br>for fear that she should fall
<br>Before they'd lie in one bed 
<br>and she'd lie next to the wall.
<br>
</p><p>“But,” said the pretty lady, 
<br>“before you me perplex
<br>It's you must answer questions yet 
<br>and that is questions six.
<br>It's questions six you must tell me 
<br>and that is three times twa
<br>Before I'll lie in your bed 
<br>at either stock or wall.”
<br>
</p><p>“Oh, what is greener than the grass, 
<br>what is higher than the trees?
<br>What is worse than a woman's scorn, 
<br>what is deeper than the seas?
<br>What was the first bird that did crow 
<br>and what did first down fall?
<br>Before I'll lie in your bed 
<br>at either stock or wall.”
<br>
</p><p>“Oh, envy's greener than the grass 
<br>and is higher than the trees,
<br>The Devil is worse than a woman's scorn, 
<br>Hell is deeper than the seas.
<br>The cock was the first bird that did crow 
<br>and the dew did first down fall,
<br>So we'll both lie in one bed 
<br>and you'll lie next to the wall.”
<br>
</p><p><i>Lying next to the wall could be seen to imply several things 
</i><br><i>If it were not for the lady first setting riddles it could be seen 
</i><br><i>as her being trapped, but a more likely interpretation in this 
</i><br><i>case might be that the Captain needs to be away from the wall
</i><br><i>so that he might get up quickly if the enraged father arrives.
