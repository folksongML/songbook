<h2 id=''>All around my hat
</h2>
</p><p>My love she was fair, and my love she was handsome,
<br>And cruel were the judges that sentenced her away.
<br>For thieving was a thing that she never was inclined to;
<br>They sent my love across the sea ten thousand miles away.
<br>
</p><p><i>All around my hat, I will wear a green willow,
</i><br><i>And all around my hat, for a twelve-month and a day.
</i><br><i>And if anyone should ask me the reason why I'm wearing it:
</i><br><i>It's all for my true love who's far, far away.
</i><br>
</p><p>Seven long, long years my love and I are parted,
<br>Seven long, long years they've sentenced her away.
<br>Seven long years I'll love my love and never be false-hearted
<br>And never sigh or sorrow though she's far, far away.
<br>
</p><p>Some young men are false amd they're full of all deceving,
<br>Seeking for some young girl they mean to lead astray.
<br>And when they have deceived them, so cruelly they leave them;
<br>But I'll love my love forever though she's far, far away.
