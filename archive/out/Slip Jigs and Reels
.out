<h2 id=''>Slip Jigs and Reels
</h2><i>Steve Tilston

</p><p>He was barely a man in his grandfather's coat
<br>Sewn into the lining, a ten-shilling note
<br>Goodbye to the family, goodbye to the shore
<br>Till I taste good fortune, you'll see me no more
<br>
</p><p>The boat on the ocean tossed like a cork
<br>Then one fine morning they sighted New York
<br>And he stood on the gangplank and breathed in the air
<br>"Hello land of plenty, I've come for my share"
<br>
</p><p><i>And he did like the ladies, the rise and the fall
</i><br><i>Of their ankles and dresses, down on the dance floor
</i><br><i>And rolling the dice and spinning the wheels
</i><br><i>But he took most delight in the slip jigs and reels
</i><br>
</p><p>There's talk a pistol and some say a knife
<br>But all are agreed there was somebody's wife
<br>Some kind of commotion, a terrible fight
<br>He left a man dead and ran into the night
<br>
</p><p>A train to St. Louis, just one jump ahead
<br>He slept one eye open, a six-gun in bed
<br>And he dreamt of the mountains and green fields of home
<br>While crossing the plains where the buffalo roam
<br>
</p><p><i>And he did like the ladies, the rise and the fall
</i><br><i>Of their ankles and dresses, down on the dance floor
</i><br><i>And rolling the dice and spinning the wheels
</i><br><i>But he took most delight in the slip jigs and reels
</i><br>
</p><p>Oh, bad reputation's a hard thing to bear
<br>Mothers pour scorn and young children they stare
<br>But he found consolation in flash company
<br>Your life ain't so bad with a girl on your knee
<br>
</p><p>Oh, they called him the Kid, and by twenty-one
<br>All that he knew was the power of the gun
<br>And by twenty-three, he'd shot five men down
<br>Who got in his way as he rambled around
<br>
</p><p><i>And he did like the ladies, the rise and the fall
</i><br><i>Of their ankles and dresses, down on the dance floor
</i><br><i>And rolling the dice and spinning the wheels
</i><br><i>But he took most delight in the slip jigs and reels
</i><br>
</p><p>There's bones in the desert and buzzards that fly
<br>In the highest of circles, just wishing he'd die
<br>But in matters of cruelty, it must be said
<br>A landlord will pick your bones before you're dead
<br>
</p><p>It was wild mescaleros, I heard people say
<br>In the deadliest ambush near old Santa Fe
<br>And a young buck was taken dressed in a coat
<br>And inside the lining, a ten-shilling note
<br>
</p><p><i>And he did like the ladies, the rise and the fall
</i><br><i>Of their ankles and dresses, down on the dance floor
</i><br><i>And rolling the dice and spinning the wheels
</i><br><i>But he took most delight in the slip jigs and reels
