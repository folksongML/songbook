<h2 id=>Good King Wenceslas

</p><p>Good King Wenceslas looked out
<br>On the feast of Stephen
<br>When the snow lay round about
<br>Deep and crisp and even
<br>Brightly shone the moon that night
<br>Though the frost was cruel
<br>When a poor man came in sight
<br>Gath'ring winter fuel
<br>
</p><p>"Hither, page, and stand by me
<br>If thou know'st it, telling
<br>Yonder peasant, who is he?
<br>Where and what his dwelling?"
<br>"Sire, he lives a good league hence
<br>Underneath the mountain
<br>Right against the forest fence
<br>By Saint Agnes' fountain."
<br>
</p><p>"Bring me flesh and bring me wine
<br>Bring me pine logs hither
<br>Thou and I will see him dine
<br>When we bear him thither."
<br>Page and monarch forth they went
<br>Forth they went together
<br>Through the rude wind's wild lament
<br>And the bitter weather
<br>
</p><p>"Sire, the night is darker now
<br>And the wind blows stronger
<br>Fails my heart, I know not how,
<br>I can go no longer."
<br>"Mark my footsteps, my good page
<br>Tread thou in them boldly
<br>Thou shalt find the winter's rage
<br>Freeze thy blood less coldly."
<br>
</p><p>In his master's steps he trod
<br>Where the snow lay dinted
<br>Heat was in the very sod
<br>Which the Saint had printed
<br>Therefore, Christian men, be sure
<br>Wealth or rank possessing
<br>Ye who now will bless the poor
<br>Shall yourselves find blessing 
<br>
