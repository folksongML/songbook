<h2 id=''>High Barbary (Second Version)
</h2>
</p><p>Look ahead, look a stern, 
<br>Look to weather and the lee,
<br><i>Blow high! Blow low! And so sailed we.
</i><br>I see a wreck to the windward
<br>And a lofty ship to lee,
<br><i>A sailing down all on 
</i><br><i>The coasts of High Barbary
</i><br>
</p><p>And hails her our captain
<br>he called o'er the side
<br><i>Blow high! Blow low! And so sailed we.
</i><br>o are you a pirate
<br>or man o war he cried
<br><i>A sailing down all on 
</i><br><i>The coasts of High Barbary
</i><br>
</p><p>O are you a pirate 
<br>Or a man-o-war? cried we.
<br><i>Blow high! Blow low! And so sailed we.
</i><br>O no! I'm not a pirate
<br>But a man-o-war, cried he.
<br><i>A sailing down all on 
</i><br><i>The coasts of High Barbary
</i><br>
</p><p>then back up your topsails
<br>And heave your vessel to;
<br><i>Blow high! Blow low! And so sailed we.
</i><br>For we have got some letters
<br>To be carried home by you.
<br><i>A sailing down all on 
</i><br><i>The coasts of High Barbary
</i><br>
</p><p>we'll back up our topsails
<br>an heave our vessel to
<br><i>Blow high! Blow low! And so sailed we.
</i><br>but only in some harbour
<br>and along the side of you
<br><i>A sailing down all on 
</i><br><i>The coasts of High Barbary
</i><br>
</p><p>For broadside, for broadside
<br>They fought all on the main;
<br><i>Blow high! Blow low! And so sailed we.
</i><br>Until at last the frigate
<br>Shot the pirate's mast away.
<br><i>A sailing down all on 
</i><br><i>The coasts of High Barbary
</i><br>
</p><p>For quarters! For quarters!
<br>The saucy pirates cried,
<br><i>Blow high! Blow low! And so sailed we.
</i><br>The quarters that we showed them
<br>Was to sink them in the tide.
<br><i>A sailing down all on 
</i><br><i>The coasts of High Barbary
</i><br>
</p><p>With cutlass and gun,
<br>O we fought for hours three;
<br><i>Blow high! Blow low! And so sailed we.
</i><br>The ship it was their coffin
<br>And their grave it was the sea.
<br><i>A sailing down all on 
</i><br><i>The coasts of High Barbary﻿
</i><br>
</p><p>but O it was a cruel sight
<br>and grivous for sure
<br><i>Blow high! Blow low! And so sailed we.
</i><br>to see them all a-drownin'
<br>as they tried to swim to shore
<br><i>A sailing down all on 
</i><br><i>The coasts of High Barbary﻿
</i><br>
</p><p>Look ahead, look a stern, 
<br>Look the weather in the lee,
<br><i>Blow high! Blow low! And so sailed we.
</i><br>I see a wreck to the windward
<br>And a lofty ship to lee,
<br><i>A sailing down all on 
</i><br><i>The coasts of High Barbary﻿
