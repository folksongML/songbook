<h2 id=''>The Diggers Song
</h2><i>Tr Arr. Gerrad Winstanley
</i><br>
</p><p>You noble Diggers all, 
<br><i>stand up now, stand up now,
</i><br>You noble Diggers all, 
<br><i>stand up now,
</i><br>The waste land to maintain, 
<br>seeing Cavaliers by name
<br>Your digging do distain 
<br>and your persons all defame
<br><i>Stand up now, Diggers all.
</i><br>
</p><p>Your houses they pull down, 
<br><i>stand up now, stand up now,
</i><br>Your houses they pull down, 
<br><i>stand up now.
</i><br>Your houses they pull down 
<br>to fright poor men in town,
<br>But the gentry must come down 
<br>and the poor shall wear the crown.
<br><i>Stand up now, Diggers all.
</i><br>
</p><p>With spades and hoes and ploughs, 
<br><i>stand up now, stand up now,
</i><br>With spades and hoes and ploughs, 
<br><i>stand up now.
</i><br>Your freedom to uphold, 
<br>seeing Cavaliers are bold
<br>To kill you if they could 
<br>and rights from you withhold.
<br><i>Stand up now, Diggers all.
</i><br>
</p><p>Their self-will is their law, 
<br><i>stand up now, stand up now,
</i><br>Their self-will is their law, 
<br><i>stand up now.
</i><br>Since tyranny came in 
<br>they count it now no sin
<br>To make a gaol a gin 
<br>and to serve poor men therein.
<br><i>Stand up now, Diggers all.
</i><br>
</p><p>The gentry are all round, 
<br><i>stand up now, stand up now,
</i><br>The gentry are all round, 
<br><i>stand up now.
</i><br>The gentry are all round, 
<br>on each side they are found,
<br>Their wisdom's so profound 
<br>to cheat us of the ground.
<br><i>Stand up now, Diggers all.
</i><br>
</p><p>The lawyers they conjoin, 
<br><i>stand up now, stand up now,
</i><br>The lawyers they conjoin, 
<br><i>stand up now,
</i><br>To arrest you they advise, 
<br>such fury they devise,
<br>But the devil in them lies, 
<br>and hath blinded both their eyes.
<br><i>Stand up now, Diggers all.
</i><br>
</p><p>The clergy they come in, 
<br><i>stand up now, stand up now,
</i><br>The clergy they come in, 
<br><i>stand up now.
</i><br>The clergy they come in 
<br>and say it is a sin
<br>That we should now begin 
<br>our freedom for to win.
<br><i>Stand up now, Diggers all.
</i><br>
</p><p>'Gainst lawyers and 'gainst priests, 
<br><i>stand up now, stand up now,
</i><br>'Gainst lawyers and 'gainst Priests, 
<br><i>stand up now.
</i><br>For tyrants are they both 
<br>even flat against their oath,
<br>To grant us they are loath 
<br>free meat and drink and cloth.
<br><i>Stand up now, Diggers all.
</i><br>
</p><p>The club is all their law, 
<br><i>stand up now, stand up now,
</i><br>The club is all their law, 
<br><i>stand up now.
</i><br>The club is all their law 
<br>to keep poor folk in awe,
<br>Buth they no vision saw 
<br>to maintain such a law.
<br><i>Glory now, Diggers all.
