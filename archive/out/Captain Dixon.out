<h2 id=''>Captain Dixon
</h2>
</p><p>A nobleman's fair daughter 
<br>was walking down yon lane
<br>When up comes Captain Dixon, 
<br>the keeper of the game
<br>Says he unto his serving man, 
<br>"If it was not for the law
<br>I'd have that maid within my bed 
<br>and she'd lie next to the wall"
<br>
</p><p>"Go away, young man," says she, 
<br>"And do not me perplex
<br>Before I lie one night with you, 
<br>you'll answer questions six
<br>Six questions you will answer, 
<br>and I will make them all
<br>Before you and I in the one bed lie 
<br>and I lie next to the wall
<br>
</p><p>What is rounder than a ring? 
<br>What's higher than a tree?
<br>What is worse than woman-scorn? 
<br>What's deeper than the sea?
<br>What tree blooms first? What bird sings best? 
<br>From where do dew drops fall?
<br>Then it's you and I in the one bed lie 
<br>and I lie next to the wall"
<br>
</p><p>"A globe is rounder than a ring, 
<br>sky higher than a tree
<br>The devil is worse than woman's scorn, 
<br>hell deeper than the sea
<br>The yew blooms first, the thrush sings best, 
<br>from heaven the dew drops fall
<br>So it's you and I in the one bed lie 
<br>and you lie next to the wall"
<br>
</p><p>"You must get for me some winter fruit 
<br>that in December grew
<br>Find for me a mantle, 
<br>a weft it never went through
<br>A sparrow's horn, a priest unshorn, 
<br>a bird without a gall
<br>Then it's you and I in the one bed lie 
<br>and I lie next to the wall"
<br>
</p><p>"My father has some winter fruit 
<br>that in December grew
<br>My mother wears a mantle, 
<br>a weft it never went through
<br>A sparrow's horn's not hard to find, 
<br>there's one in every claw
<br>Melchizedek is a priest unshorn," 
<br>and he rolled her to the wall
<br>
