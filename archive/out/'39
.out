<h2 id=''>'39
</h2><i>Brian May
</i><br>
</p><p>In the year of '39 assembled here the Volunteers
<br>In the days when lands were few
<br>Here the ship sailed out into the blue and sunny morn
<br>The sweetest sight ever seen.
<br>
</p><p>And the night followed day
<br>And the story tellers say
<br>That the score brave souls inside
<br>For many a lonely day sailed across the milky seas
<br>Never looked back, never feared, never cried.
<br>
</p><p>Don't you hear my call though you're many years away
<br>Don't you hear me calling you
<br>Write your letters in the sand
<br>For the day I take your hand
<br>In the land that our grandchildren knew.
<br>
</p><p>In the year of '39 came a ship in from the blue
<br>The volunteers came home that day
<br>And they bring good news of a world so newly born
<br>Though their hearts so heavily weigh
<br>
</p><p>For the earth is old and grey, little darling we'll away
<br>But my love this cannot be
<br>For so many years have gone though I'm older but a year
<br>Your mother's eyes from your eyes cry to me.
<br>
</p><p>Don't you hear my call though you're many years away
<br>Don't you hear me calling you
<br>Write your letters in the sand
<br>For the day I take your hand
<br>In the land that our grandchildren knew.
<br>
</p><p>Don't you hear my call though you're many years away
<br>Don't you hear me calling you
<br>All your letters in the sand cannot heal me like your hand
<br>
</p><p>For my life
<br>Still ahead
<br>Pity Me.
