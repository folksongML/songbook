<h2 id=''>The Drunken Scotsman
</h2>
</p><p>Well a Scotsman clad in kilt 
<br>left a bar one evening fair
<br>And one could tell by how he walked 
<br>that he’d drunk more than his share
<br>He fumbled round until he could 
<br>no longer keep his feet
<br>Then he stumbled off into the grass 
<br>to sleep beside the street
<br>
</p><p><i>Ring ding diddle diddle I de oh 
</i><br><i>ring di diddly I oh
</i><br><i>He stumbled off into the grass 
</i><br><i>to sleep beside the street
</i><br>
</p><p>About that time two young 
<br>and lovely girls just happened by
<br>And one says to the other 
<br>with a twinkle in her eye
<br>See young sleeping Scotsman 
<br>so strong and handsome built
<br>I wonder if it’s true what they 
<br>don’t wear beneath the kilt
<br>
</p><p><i>Ring ding diddle diddle I de oh 
</i><br><i>ring di diddly I oh
</i><br><i>I wonder if it’s true what they 
</i><br><i>don’t wear beneath the kilt
</i><br>
</p><p>They crept up on that sleeping Scotsman 
<br>quiet as could be
<br>Lifted up his kilt 
<br>about an inch so they could see
<br>And there behold, for them to view, 
<br>beneath his Scottish skirt
<br>Was nothing more than God 
<br>had graced him with upon his birth
<br>
</p><p><i>Ring ding diddle diddle I de oh 
</i><br><i>ring di diddly I oh
</i><br><i>Was nothing more than God
</i><br><i>had graced him with upon his birth
</i><br>
</p><p>They marveled for a moment, 
<br>then one said we must be gone
<br>Let’s leave a present for our friend, 
<br>before we move along
<br>As a gift they left a blue silk ribbon, 
<br>tied into a bow
<br>Around the bonnie star, 
<br>the Scots kilt did lift and show
<br>
</p><p><i>Ring ding diddle diddle I de oh 
</i><br><i>ring di diddly I oh
</i><br><i>Around the bonnie star, 
</i><br><i>the Scots kilt did lift and show
</i><br>
</p><p>Now the Scotsman woke to nature’s call 
<br>and stumbled toward the trees
<br>Behind a bush, he lifts his kilt 
<br>and gawks at what he sees
<br>And in a startled voice he says 
<br>to what’s before his eyes.
<br>O lad I don’t know where you been 
<br>but I see you won first prize
<br>
