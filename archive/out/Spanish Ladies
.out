<h2 id=''>Spanish Ladies
</h2>
</p><p>Farewell and adieu 
<br>unto you Spanish ladies
<br>Farewell and adieu 
<br>to you ladies of Spain
<br>For we've received orders 
<br>to sail for old England
<br>But we hope very soon 
<br>we shall see you again
<br>
</p><p><i>We'll rant and we'll roar 
</i><br><i>like true British sailors
</i><br><i>We'll rant and we'll roar 
</i><br><i>across the salt seas
</i><br><i>Until we strike soundings 
</i><br><i>in the Channel of Old England
</i><br><i>From Ushant to Scilly 
</i><br><i>is thirty-five leagues
</i><br>
</p><p>We hove our ship to 
<br>with the wind at sou'west, boys
<br>We hove our ship to, 
<br>our soundings to see
<br>So we rounded and sounded; 
<br>got forty-five fathoms
<br>We squared our main yard 
<br>and up channel steered we
<br>
</p><p>Now the first land we made 
<br>it is called the Dodman
<br>Next Reme Head off Plymouth, 
<br>off Portland the Wight
<br>We sailed by Beachy, 
<br>by Fairlee and Dungeness
<br>Till we came abreast 
<br>of the South Foreland Light
<br>
</p><p><i>We'll rant and we'll roar 
</i><br><i>like true British sailors
</i><br><i>We'll rant and we'll roar 
</i><br><i>across the salt seas
</i><br><i>Until we strike soundings 
</i><br><i>in the Channel of Old England
</i><br><i>From Ushant to Scilly 
</i><br><i>is thirty-five leagues
</i><br>
</p><p>Then the signal was made 
<br>for the grand fleet to anchor
<br>All in the Downs 
<br>that night for to lie
<br>Then it's stand by your stoppers, 
<br>see clear your shank-painters,
<br>Haul all your clew garnets, 
<br>let tacks and sheets fly
<br>
</p><p><i>Now let every man toss off a full bumper
</i><br><i>And let every man drink off a full glass
</i><br><i>And we'll drink and be merry and drown melancholy
</i><br><i>Singing, here's a good health to each true-hearted lass
</i><br>
</p><p>
